// A 429 with no retry-after and no anthropic-ratelimit-* headers is upstream
// refusing the REQUEST (a model id it will not serve), not throttling the
// account. It used to be treated as a throttle: the account was paused for a
// fabricated 60s, so every other session on it waited, and the client was held
// for the same 60s per attempt (#288). Now nothing is paused.
//
// It is not always a refusal, though. Measured over a 32-minute window on one
// fleet: Fable requests drew one about every 8 minutes and no other model drew
// any; they arrived in 0.6-0.8s, started from four different accounts, and
// followed the request onto the account the hop moved it to — and the client's
// own retry usually succeeded. So the request now gets its one hop AND one
// short retry on the account it landed on, and only then does the 429 go back
// to the client, without a made-up retry-after.
