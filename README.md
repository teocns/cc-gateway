---

cc-gateway is a small proxy that runs on your machine. Claude Code talks to it instead of Anthropic.
Log in all your accounts once: when one runs out, the next request goes out on another.

```
$ cc-gateway
gateway   on · 2 accounts · every new claude goes through :4747
account   alice@example.com   usable  expires 2h
account   bob@example.com     usable  expires 5h
```

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teocns/cc-gateway/main/install.sh | sh
```

<details>
<summary>While the repo is private · Windows · uninstall</summary>

```sh
# private repo: the same installer, through gh
gh api repos/teocns/cc-gateway/contents/install.sh -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" | sh

# remove: turn it off first, then the installer takes back what it put down
cc-gateway disable
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/teocns/cc-gateway/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
# your accounts and config stay
```

The installer is macOS and Linux. The service itself runs on Windows too: see
[operations.md](docs/operations.md).
</details>

## Quick start

```sh
cc-gateway account login     # browser login — once per account
cc-gateway enable            # start it, now and at every login
cc-gateway run -- claude     # a claude that goes through it
```

`cc-gateway disable` turns it off. Claude goes back to its own login.

## Without it, and with it

| | plain `claude` | `claude` through cc-gateway |
|---|---|---|
| **Accounts** | one login at a time | a pool, used in turn |
| **Out of quota** | you wait | the next account answers |
| **What was sent** | guessed from the transcript | every request recorded: model, tokens, timing, account |
| **Rules** | none | deny a model, cap a budget, redact, add to the system prompt |

## Why cc-gateway

- 🔁 **Rotation that knows quota.** It reads each account's 5-hour and weekly limits and fails over on rate limits, server errors and expired tokens.
- 📌 **Pin when it matters.** `cc-gateway run --account work -- claude` keeps one session on one account.
- 🔍 **See the real prompt.** `cc-gateway xray claude -p "hi"` shows the exact system prompt, tools and messages, and sends nothing.
- 📊 **Watch it live.** `cc-gateway tui` shows quota bars per account and every request in flight.
- 🔒 **Local only.** It listens on localhost and refuses web pages. Tokens live in one owner-only file.
- 📦 **Nothing to install.** Zero dependencies, Node ≥ 22.7, runs as a service on macOS, Linux and Windows.

<details>
<summary>Good to know</summary>

- Model calls go through cc-gateway. A few other Claude Code calls (telemetry, startup checks)
  still go straight to Anthropic: [security.md](docs/security.md).
- Claude Code turns off MCP tool search behind any gateway. cc-gateway turns it back on:
  [claude-code.md](docs/claude-code.md).
- A running `claude` keeps the route it started with. Only new launches follow `enable` and `disable`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>With cc-shim, or inside the agentic kit</summary>

With [cc-shim](https://github.com/teocns/cc-shim) installed, `enable` routes every `claude` you
type, no `run` needed, and `claude --account NAME` pins a launch. Inside the agentic kit, the same
CLI is `ak gateway`.
