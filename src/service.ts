/**
 * The gateway as a user service — the part that makes it a service and not a
 * process someone once started in a terminal. What it runs is the keeper
 * (keeper.ts), which runs the gateway as a child and swaps that child without
 * closing the port; the service manager only ever sees the keeper.
 *
 * One interface, three backends, picked by the OS:
 *
 *   launchd          macOS, a LaunchAgent (service-launchd.ts)
 *   systemd          Linux, a user unit (service-systemd.ts); WSL with systemd on
 *   Task Scheduler   Windows, a logon task (service-schtasks.ts)
 *
 * Each restarts the keeper when it dies, so "stop" is never a signal to it —
 * it is the manager's own stop (bootout, `systemctl stop`, a stop request and
 * `schtasks /End`), which holds until the next login or `start`. The unit's
 * file stays on disk either way; only `uninstall` removes it.
 *
 * What is the same everywhere lives here: which node runs it, the command, the
 * port check, the release the keeper will run.
