 * Turn configured accounts into the objects the AccountManager is built from:
 * `importFrom` entries have their credentials read from disk, and entries with
 * no usable credential are dropped with a message.
 *
 * Config fields are carried through verbatim — the import supplies ONLY the
 * credential fields. Rebuilding an imported account as `{ name, type, ...creds }`
 * used to discard everything else on it (`disabled`, `priority`, `upstream`,
 * `modelMap`, `models`), so an account disabled on disk silently rejoined
 * rotation on every restart and a third-party backend lost its upstream.
